This is an independently written package by an astrodynamics hobbyist. See the HORIZONSAPI.jl  license file for more information about code sharing and usage!\n\nOverview\n\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located at the  California Institute of Technology, provides a solar  system ephemeris service called HORIZONS. It's fantastic! It can  find and  visualize periodic orbits, allow you to download position and velocity data for bodies in our solar system, list  physical parameters for celestial bodies,  and more!\n\nYou may utilize these tools using several methods, including  through a web interface,  with telnet via telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775, and even through  email! You can consult the HORIZONS documentation for more information.\n\nIn 2021, JPL released a REST API which allows users to programatically interact with HORIZONS through HTTP requests. This API is also described in the HORIZONS  documentation. This Julia package provides an interface to the HORIZONS REST API. \n\nVision\n\nActually, this package will provide two interfaces to the HORIZONS REST API! A precise interace, which matches the syntax of the requests described in the  HORIZONS documentation, will be provided. In addition, a more Julian syntax for ephemeris downloading and processing will be provided in a separate interface.\n\nCredits\n\nThis package uses HTTP.jl to process  all HTTP requests and responses!\n\nLicense\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Joe Carpinelli\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
